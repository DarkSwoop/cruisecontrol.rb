<h1>Getting started with your new project</h1>

Now that you've created a project, you should use the CCRB API to configure your project. Projects are configured 
using a <code>cruise_config.rb</code> file that gets version-controlled and placed in the root of your project. '
A typical <code>cruise_config.rb</code> file looks like this:

<pre>
<%= @config_example %>
</pre>

To see the builds for your new project, go <%= link_to "here", project_path(@project) %>.
